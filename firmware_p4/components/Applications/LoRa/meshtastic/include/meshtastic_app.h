/**
 * @brief Bring up the full Meshtastic stack on the P4.
 *
 * Order of operations:
 *   1. Derive node_num from the device MAC (last 4 bytes).
 *   2. mt_nvs_init and read persisted preset/region (LONG_FAST + US
 *      defaults on first boot).
 *   3. SX1262 HAL + driver init with the preset's SF/BW/CR and the
 *      region center frequency for the primary channel slot
 *      (Meshtastic canonical default: slot 19 = 906.875 MHz on US
 *      LONG_FAST). +20 dBm TX power, 16-symbol preamble.
 *   4. SX1262 IRQ task.
 *   5. mt_pki_init (X25519 keypair via mbedTLS Curve25519).
 *   6. mt_nodedb_init (load persisted node entries).
 *   7. mt_modules_init (Admin, NodeInfo, Position, Text, Routing,
 *      TraceRoute, Telemetry, KeyVerify, NeighborInfo).
 *   8. meshtastic_mesh_init (channels, dedup, tx queue, retry table).
 *   9. phoneapi_init (Companion state machine).
 *  10. meshtastic_phone_bridge_init (SPI bridge to C5 BLE/TCP).
 *  11. meshtastic_mesh_start (arms RX continuous + spawns TX task).
 *  12. Spawns the poll task (mesh poll at 50 ms + module tick at 1 Hz).
 *  13. Requests the C5 to start BLE advertising.
 *
 * Cannot run simultaneously with meshcore_app_start: both register
 * SX1262 callbacks via sx1262_set_callbacks and would overwrite each
 * other. Only one stack at a time.
 *
 * Must be called AFTER bridge_manager_init().
 *
 * @return
 *   - ESP_OK on success
 *   - ESP_FAIL if preset lookup or PKI init fails
 *   - Driver error code from any init step on failure
 *   - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM if the poll task cannot be spawned
