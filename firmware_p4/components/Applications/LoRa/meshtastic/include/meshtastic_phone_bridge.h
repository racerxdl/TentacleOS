 * @brief Initialize the SPI-based Meshtastic phone bridge.
 *
 * Owns the transport plumbing between the local phoneapi state machine
 * (which lives on the P4) and the radios (BLE GATT and TCP server)
 * which terminate on the C5 co-processor.
 *
 * Registers a stream callback for SPI_ID_MESH_TORADIO_STREAM that
 * reassembles chunks back into StreamAPI frames and forwards them to
 * phoneapi_on_toradio.
 *
 * Spawns a notify task that periodically drains phoneapi_poll_fromradio,
 * fragments frames into SPI chunks, and ships them to the C5 via
 * SPI_ID_MESH_FROMRADIO_PUSH so they reach the connected app.
 *
 * Captures ESP_LOG output into a ring buffer and ships it to the C5 via
 * SPI_ID_MESH_LOG_PUSH whenever a phone has subscribed to LOGRADIO.
 *
 * Does not bring up BLE or WiFi by itself. Call meshtastic_phone_bridge_ble_start
 * and meshtastic_phone_bridge_wifi_start to enable each transport.
 *
 * @param node_num  Our node number, used for advertised name.
 * @return
 *   - ESP_OK on success
 *   - ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE if already initialized
 *   - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM on allocation failure
