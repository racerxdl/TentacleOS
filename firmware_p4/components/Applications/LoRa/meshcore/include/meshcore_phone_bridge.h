/**
 * @brief Initialize the SPI-based MeshCore phone bridge.
 *
 * Owns the transport plumbing between the local phoneapi protocol layer
 * (which lives on the P4) and the BLE NUS service which terminates on
 * the C5 co-processor.
 *
 * Registers a stream callback for SPI_ID_MCORE_RX_STREAM that reassembles
 * chunks back into Companion command frames and forwards them to
 * meshcore_phoneapi_on_inbound. Hooks meshcore_phoneapi outbound so any
 * frame produced on the P4 (responses, pushes, sync drains) is fragmented
 * into SPI chunks and shipped to the C5 via SPI_ID_MCORE_TX_PUSH.
 *
 * Spawns a status task that polls SPI_ID_MCORE_STATUS so the bridge can
 * react to phone (dis)connect events and retry MCORE_BLE_INIT if the C5
 * was rebooted.
 *
 * Does not bring up BLE by itself. Call meshcore_phone_bridge_ble_start
 * after the protocol layer is ready.
 *
 * @param name_prefix  Advertised name prefix on the C5 ("<prefix>-XXXX",
 *                     where XXXX is the last 2 octets of the MAC). May
 *                     be NULL to fall back to "Highboy-MC".
 * @return
 *   - ESP_OK on success
 *   - ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE if already initialized
 *   - ESP_ERR_NO_MEM on allocation failure
