/*
 * Nested Authentication Attack for MIFARE Classic.
 *
 * When you already know at least ONE key for any sector, this attack
 * recovers keys for sectors where the dictionary failed.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  1. Authenticate to a known sector (sector_src, key_src).
 *  2. While still in the Crypto1 session, send AUTH to the target sector.
 *     The card responds with nt_target ENCRYPTED by the current Crypto1 stream.
 *  3. Decrypt nt_target using the known keystream state.
 *  4. Repeat to collect multiple (nt, nr, ar) pairs on the wire.
 *  5. Use mfkey32 to recover the target key from two wire-level auth traces.
 *
 * Works best on cards with static or weak PRNG (most clones / Gen1a / Gen2).
 * Falls back to dictionary check with known nt for all card types.
