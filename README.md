This repository contains a **firmware in development** for the **High Boy** platform.
**Warning:** this firmware is in its **beta phase** and is **still incomplete**.


## Officially Supported Targets

We are expanding support for the latest Espressif chips:

| Target | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ESP32-S3** | Main Development |
| **ESP32-P4** | Experimental (firmware_p4) |
| **ESP32-C5** | Experimental (firmware_c5) |


## Firmware Structure

Unlike basic examples with a single `main.c`, this project uses a modular structure organized into **components**, which are divided as follows:

- **Drivers** – Handles hardware drivers and interfaces.
- **Services** – Implements support functionalities and auxiliary logic.
- **Core** – Contains the system's central logic and main managers.
- **Applications** – Specific applications that use the previous modules.

This division facilitates scalability, code reuse, and firmware organization.

## How to use this project

We recommend that this project serves as a basis for custom projects with ESP32-S3.
To start a new project with ESP-IDF, follow the official guide:
[ESP-IDF Documentation - Create a new project](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html#start-a-new-project)

### Initial project structure

Despite the modular structure, the project still maintains an organization compatible with the ESP-IDF build system (CMake).

Example layout:

```bash
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── components
│   ├── Drivers
│   ├── Services
│   ├── Core
│   └── Applications
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── main.c
└── README.md
```
